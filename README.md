## About App
This app is along the lines of an event planner. You can sign up and log in and see all the events people have posted including: Title, Date of event and a Short description of the event. Once you have signed up and in you can add events to. The app allows you to update your events posts allowing you to change a date if for some reason it changes or maybe you want to change the description or title you can do it on Eventz.
